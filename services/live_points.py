"""
Live points while a gameweek is being played, from FPL's public live feed, so the Model vs actual
review and the ML manager tab update after each match instead of after the pipeline's next run
(twice a day, and the season CSV only has finished matches).

  event/{gw}/live/       every player's points and minutes so far, per fixture (`explain`)
  fixtures/?event={gw}   which of the gameweek's fixtures have started and finished

Both are fetched by the backend (never the browser) and cached for LIVE_TTL_SECONDS, so however
many people watch, FPL sees one request a minute. If FPL can't be reached, the last good answer is
used for up to STALE_SECONDS, then nothing (the pages fall back to the season CSV). Points are
FPL's own provisional totals: bonus appears once FPL adds it, about an hour after the day's last
match. Nothing here writes files; the pipeline still scores a gameweek once FPL has checked it.
