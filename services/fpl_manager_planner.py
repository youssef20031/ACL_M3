"""
The ML manager's planner: one gameweek's transfers, chip, captain and bench, chosen by looking
a few gameweeks ahead with the points model's projections.

    plan(current, projections, rules, gameweek, chips_available, horizon=4) -> the gwNN.json entry

Pure: a plain dict (the squad, bank and free transfers), a DataFrame of LIVE_DATA_DIR/
projections.csv (pipeline.predict_next_gw) and a rules dict in, the planned entry out. No files,
no network, and none of the game engine's types (services/fpl_manager.py).

How it decides
  * Pool: the current squad, the best POOL_PER_POSITION players per position by decayed horizon
    points, and CHEAP_PER_POSITION cheap fillers per position.
  * One multi-period MILP (scipy.optimize.milp / HiGHS, like team_optimizer.best_squad) over the
    horizon: per gameweek a squad (2/5/5/3, at most `team_limit` per club), an XI (1 GK, 3-5 DEF,
    2-5 MID, 1-3 FWD), a captain, the first two outfield substitutes, and players bought (at
    now_cost) and sold (at the current squad's selling prices; a player bought within the horizon
    sells at now_cost), with the bank carried and never negative. Free transfers follow FPL: the
    ones not used are banked up to `max_free_transfers`, and each transfer beyond them costs
    `hit_cost` points (at most MAX_HITS_PER_GW a gameweek). The objective is each gameweek's XI
    points, the captain's points again and the bench weighted like team_optimizer.best_squad
    (BENCH_WEIGHTS / BENCH_GK_WEIGHT; after this gameweek every outfield substitute gets their
    mean), minus hits, discounted by DECAY per gameweek ahead, plus FT_END_VALUE per free transfer still
    banked after the horizon (so a free transfer isn't spent on a tiny gain just because the
    horizon ends) and tiny tie-breaks (fewer transfers, more money in the bank, then the pool's
    order), so a plan is the same on every run.
  * Speed: the budget is what makes the MILP hard (without it a solve takes 0.1 s); a realistic
    pool of ~125 players takes about 5-25 s per solve on a laptop. A solve that reaches
    SOLVE_TIME_LIMIT keeps its best plan so far (Solution.optimal False). Chip solves that the
    policy can't pick are skipped (chip_may_play).
  * Only the first gameweek's moves are returned: the pipeline replans every run.
  * Chips, one per gameweek and only this gameweek's: the same MILP is solved without a chip and
    with each available one, and chip_decision (below) compares them.
  * Captain and vice: team_optimizer.pick_captains on the chosen XI, with each player's chance of
    playing (the projections' `availability` for this gameweek, else 1). Bench: the substitute
    goalkeeper first, then outfield players by projected points (team_optimizer.order_bench).

Prices and the bank are integers in tenths (1000 = 100.0m).
