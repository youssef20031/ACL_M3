"""
Rich answer cards for the assistant: the `cards` and `follow_ups` fields of POST /api/query.

The LLM writes the text; these typed blocks are what the frontend draws with it: player
profiles, comparisons, leaderboards, next-gameweek predictions, team, results and season
summaries, "notable stats" highlights and follow-up questions. They are built from
structured data only (the pipeline's query rows, a few small Cypher lookups, the predictions
file and the cached current-season fixtures), never parsed from the answer text. No LLM or
network call is made: photos come from `photo_for` (the avatar cache and FPL photo codes).

Layout, as in services/season_service.py:
  * pure functions that shape rows into cards and compute highlights (tested without Neo4j);
  * the Cypher for the extra lookups;
  * build_cards(), which picks the cards for an intent and runs their lookups concurrently.
A card that fails to build is logged and skipped; it never breaks the answer.

Every card is a dict with a `type` ("player", "comparison", "leaderboard", "prediction",
"team", "fixtures", "season" or "pitch") and an `id`; src/services/api.ts has the TypeScript
shapes.
