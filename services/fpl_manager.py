"""
The ML manager: a season-long FPL team run by the points model under FPL's rules.

This module is the game engine (pure functions over plain dicts) plus its files. FPL's
rules (Rules, read from bootstrap-static's game_settings, element_types and chips, with the
2026-27 values as defaults):

  squad      15 players (2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD), at most 3 per club, 100.0m (a club over
             the limit because an owned player moved there may stay so, but never grow). The XI
             is 1 GK, 3-5 DEF, 2-5 MID and 1-3 FWD. Bench order 1 is the substitute
             goalkeeper, 2-4 the outfield subs in priority order (FPL's layout).
  prices     a player is bought at now_cost and sold at purchase + half the rise, rounded
             down, or at now_cost when the price fell (selling_price). Money is in tenths.
  transfers  the first squad is free. After that each gameweek adds a free transfer, and
             unused ones are banked up to 5 (next_free_transfers). Each transfer beyond the
             free ones costs 4 points. Wildcard and free hit allow unlimited transfers, and
             the banked free transfers are kept.
  chips      wildcard, free hit, bench boost and triple captain, each once per half (the
             bootstrap's "chips" windows: GW2-19 / GW20-38 for wildcard and free hit,
             GW1-19 / GW20-38 for the others), at most one a gameweek. A first-half chip
             not used by GW19 expires. After a free hit the squad, its purchase prices and
             the bank revert to what they were before it.
  scoring    the XI after FPL's auto-subs (team_optimizer.apply_auto_subs); the captain's
             points x2, or x3 with triple captain, going to the vice-captain when the
             captain didn't play; with bench boost all 15 count; minus hits (score_entry).

Files, in $LIVE_DATA_DIR/ml_manager/<season>/:
  gwNN.json          one entry per gameweek played: squad, transfers, chip, plan and result.
                     Status "planned" (the plan is saved again on every run before the
                     deadline), then "locked" once the deadline passes (its decisions can't
                     change: save_entry refuses), then "scored" with `result` filled in.
  state.json         replay() of the locked and scored entries: squad with purchase prices,
                     bank, free transfers for the next gameweek, chips used, history and
                     totals. Derived and rebuilt by rebuild_state; never the source of truth.
  rules.json         the Rules last read from bootstrap-static (save_rules).
  league_cache.json  ranks in FPL's "Gameweek 9" league (services/fpl_manager_league).

The manager starts in ML_MANAGER_START_GW (GW9 2026-27) with the v4 squad the pipeline saved
before that deadline (model_picks/<season>/gw09.json, start_entry_from_pick). The plans come
from services/fpl_manager_planner and the daily run is pipeline/ml_manager.
get_manager_view builds the /api/ml-manager payload. Nothing here makes network calls.
