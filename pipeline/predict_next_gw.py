"""
Regenerate next-gameweek point predictions from fresh data.

    python -m pipeline.predict_next_gw [--live-dir data/live] [--backtest GW] [--no-odds-fetch]

Inputs:
  * FPL API: the next gameweek (bootstrap event with `is_next`) and its fixtures.
  * LIVE_DATA_DIR (written by `python -m pipeline.current_season`): this season's
    finished matches (FPL_YYYY_YYYY.csv) and every current player's status/news, FPL code
    and this gameweek's transfers in/out, plus our pre-deadline element_snapshots archive.
  * LIVE_DATA_DIR/odds: football-data.co.uk's odds, refreshed at the start of every run
    (pipeline.current_season.refresh_odds: this season's file and fixtures.csv, earlier
    seasons once). A failed download only leaves the odds features NaN.
  * data/cleaned_merged_seasons_cleaned.csv: all historical seasons (the last 3 for the
    features, plus the small team-match table that team ratings start from).
  * The served points model, v4 (ml.points_model.load_model(): LIVE_DATA_DIR/models/points_v4.json
    from the weekly retrain, else the bundled ml/models/points_v4.json; v3 until a v4 exists).

Output: LIVE_DATA_DIR/next_gw_predictions.csv (+ .json), same schema as the old
ml/predictions/next_gw_predictions.csv plus a few transparency columns, written
atomically. services/predictions.py prefers this file over the bundled one. Before the
deadline it also saves the gameweek's squad pick (services/model_review.save_picks) for
the Team of the Week page's "Model vs actual" review, and every run writes the model's
inputs for each upcoming row (next_gw_features.csv), which services/explain.py turns into
SHAP and LIME explanations for the /model page.

Projections: the same run writes LIVE_DATA_DIR/projections.csv, every current player's points
for the next PROJECTION_HORIZON gameweeks (the ML manager's planner, services/fpl_manager_planner,
plans transfers over them). The first gameweek is next_gw_predictions itself; each later one is
predicted by the same model from the same pre-deadline history (one build_features call per
gameweek, with only that gameweek's fixtures, so form, team strength, price, ownership,
transfers and the FPL snapshot all stay as they are now), with days_rest measured to the
team's real previous fixture, odds only where fixtures.csv already prices the match, and
horizon_availability's rule for flagged players. A failure there is logged and never touches
the predictions.

Shadow: the same run also scores the previous production model, v3 (LIVE_DATA_DIR/models/
points_v3.json if present, else the bundled one; no longer retrained), on the same feature rows
with the same chance-of-playing multiplier, and saves its squad pick before the deadline in
model_picks/<season>/shadow/ (same files and selection as the live pick). Only the live
predictions and pick reach the site; scripts/analysis/shadow_ledger.py compares the two picks
gameweek by gameweek, on gameweeks nobody selected on. A failing shadow never affects the live
predictions.

How a prediction is built: each player gets one row per fixture of the predicted
gameweek and goes through ml.points_model.build_features together with his real
match history, so features are computed by exactly the code used in training and
only from matches before the gameweek (rows from the predicted gameweek or later
are dropped before anything is computed).

  * Double gameweek: one row per fixture, predictions summed.
  * Blank gameweek: the player is kept with 0 points and opponent "No fixture".
  * Availability: status u/n, or chance_of_playing_next_round 0 -> 0 points; a 25/50/75%
    doubt -> points x 0.61/0.77/0.91 (availability_factor). v4 already lowers flagged
    players' predictions from FPL's availability before the deadline (snap_*, from the
    status file), so chance/100 on top counted the flags twice; those factors are fitted
    against v4's own predictions (ml.snapshots.DOUBT_POINTS).
  * Players are keyed by FPL code (the status file's `code`), so a renamed player keeps
    his history; the shadow predicts from the same rows.
