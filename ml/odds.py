"""
Pre-match bookmaker odds as team features of the v4 points model (ml/points_model.py, since
2026-10-28): each team's implied chance of winning, expected goals for and against, and
clean-sheet probability.

The ML backtest (scripts/analysis/ml_backtest.py, variants odds, odds_close and odds_rt) found
top-20 gains that were positive in every protocol; on top of the ratings and transfer features
(odds_rt) they beat v3 under refit, early stopping and the weekly retrain on 2023-24 .. 2026-27,
though not on 2022-23 (2026-10, see CLAUDE.md).

Source: football-data.co.uk's Premier League files (mmz4281/{yyyy}/E0.csv, one per season, with
the current season updated twice a week) for training, and its fixtures.csv (upcoming matches of
every league it covers, kept to Div E0; same columns and collection times) for the upcoming
gameweek. The data is free for private, non-commercial use and isn't licensed for redistribution,
so the CSVs are not committed: fetch_season and fetch_fixtures (scripts/data/fetch_odds.py)
download them into ODDS_DIR, which is data/odds (gitignored) unless the ODDS_DIR environment
variable says otherwise (production: $LIVE_DATA_DIR/odds, on the data volume). The ML workflows
fetch them in CI.

Each match has two sets of prices (market averages, Bet365 where an average is missing):
  pre-closing  collected on Friday afternoon (by 17:00 UK time) for Friday-Monday matches and on
               Tuesday (by 13:00) for Tuesday-Thursday matches; FEATURES
  closing      at kickoff, so after the FPL deadline and after lineups are out; CLOSING_FEATURES
               are an upper bound only and can't be served

Leakage rule (tests/test_points_model.py): a pre-closing price counts only if its collection time
(collected_at) is no later than the FPL deadline, 90 minutes before the gameweek's first kickoff.
In a normal gameweek it always is. A midweek match inside a weekend gameweek (a rearranged match
in a double gameweek) gets NaN, which is also all that serving would have at the deadline. The
same rule applies to upcoming rows, whose prices come from a fixtures.csv fetched before the
prediction run, so before the deadline. A run before Friday's (or Tuesday's) collection finds no
prices yet and predicts with NaN odds; the last run before the deadline has them.

Goals come from a Poisson fit: the total from the over/under 2.5 price, the split between the two
teams from the 1X2 prices (P(home) - P(away)), each with the bookmaker margin removed.
